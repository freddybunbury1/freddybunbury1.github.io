I am intrigued by the metabolic and physical interactions between microbes and their environment. I have worked with algae from Antarctica to cyanobacteria in the hot springs of Yellowstone National Park. Nutrient exchange underpins many symbioses and I have focused on the transfer of vitamin B12 from bacteria to algae in return for photosynthate. Physical associations are also a crucial facet of symbioses and I have explored how motility and cellular interactions between Cyanobacteria and Chloroflexota build biofilm structure. Currently, I am focusing on the adaptations and acclimation mechanisms that thermophilic cyanobacteria have acquired and use to survive at the upper temperature limit for oxygenic photosynthesis.
