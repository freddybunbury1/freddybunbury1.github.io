I am a Research Scientist at the University of Chicago. My research focuses on microbial stress responses, from short-term acclimation to long-term evolution. I currently investigate how the most heat-tolerant photosynthetic microbes on Earth survive in the extreme environment of Yellowstone's hot springs. Our work explores the genetic features that enable these cyanobacteria to withstand high temperatures and the acclimation responses they induce as temperatures fluctuate. Additionally, I collaborate with Seppe Kuehn's lab to study nutrient transfer between microbes, with a focus on the vitamin B12 exchange between bacteria and algae.
