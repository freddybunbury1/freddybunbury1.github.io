I am a Research Scientist at the University of Chicago. My research has broadly focused on environmental microbial responses to their physical and chemical environment, from short-term acclimation to long-term evolution. I currently investigate how the most heat-tolerant photosynthetic microbes on Earth survive in the extreme environment of Yellowstone's hot springs. Our work explores the genetic features that enable these cyanobacteria to withstand high temperatures and the acclimation responses they induce as temperatures fluctuate. Additionally, I currently collaborate with Seppe Kuehn's lab to study nutrient transfer between microbes, with a focus on the vitamin B12 exchange between bacteria and algae.
